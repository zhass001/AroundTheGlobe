# AroundTheGlobe
Through this project we aim to devise a mechanism to enhance an individualâ€™s experience of the world by helping them examine the diversity around the continents, countries, provinces, cities and regions with the help of visualizations of representative images on the world map using Open Layers. We have crawled geo-tagged images from Flickr using Python, downloading images and storing their details in Mongo DB database using JSON, training a Linear Regression model to rank images for each location based on derived parameters and showing visualizations of the top ranked images at different zoom levels on world map using Open Layers
